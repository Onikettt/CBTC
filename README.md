# Internship Project: Data Science at Cipher Byte Technologies

Welcome to my internship project repository! This repository showcases the data science projects I worked on during my internship at Cipher Byte Technologies. As a college student, this internship has provided me with invaluable real-world experience in the field of data science.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Iris Flower Classification Using DecisionTreeClassifier

#### Overview
This project focuses on classifying Iris flower species using the DecisionTreeClassifier algorithm. The Iris dataset is a classic benchmark in machine learning and consists of measurements of sepals and petals of three different species of Iris flowers.

#### Contents
- **Jupyter Notebook:** [iris_classification.ipynb](iris_classification.ipynb)
- **Dataset:** [Iris Flower - Iris](data/iris.csv)

#### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `iris_classification.ipynb`.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Ensure you have the `Iris Flower - Iris.csv` dataset file available in the `data` directory or update the file path accordingly.

### 2. Spam Email Detection using Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

#### Overview
This project focuses on detecting spam emails using the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithm.

#### Contents
- **Jupyter Notebook:** [spam_detection.ipynb](spam_detection.ipynb)
- **Dataset:** [Spam Email Detection - spam](data/spam_emails.csv)

#### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `spam_detection.ipynb`.
2. Follow the detailed instructions provided in the notebook to preprocess the text data, extract features, train the SVC model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Make sure to have the `Spam Email Detection - spam.csv` dataset file available in the `data` directory or update the file path accordingly.

## Requirements
To run the notebooks and replicate my results, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## About Me
I am a college student pursuing a degree in Information Technology at NiT. This internship project is part of my academic journey and has provided me with valuable hands-on experience in the field of data science.
